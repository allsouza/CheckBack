# CoffeeWages

CoffeeWages is an app focused on providing transparency to people working on the service industry, by allowing workers to post about their working conditions and consumers to frequent businesses that treat their employees fairly.

# Functionalities

## Employee insights

Annonymous information about the business in regards to salary, working conditions, overall worker satisfaction.
* Employees can add their annonymous review the business they work at

## Costumer side

Costumers will be able to find local businesses around them, using a Map interface, or by searching for a business by name.  And get an overview of how the business treats its employees.  The hope is that armed with this information costumers will give their business to places that treat their employees well, which will cause toxic places of employment to either change their ways or go out of business.
